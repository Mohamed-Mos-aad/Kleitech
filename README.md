## 💧 Kleitech – Smart Kidney Care Platform

**Kleitech** is a full‑stack smart healthcare platform for kidney patients that combines a modern React + TypeScript frontend, a robust Laravel 11 REST API, and an AI image‑analysis service. It focuses on real‑world patient workflows: secure onboarding, medical image triage, appointment booking, reminder automation, and rich communication between patients, doctors, and admins.

The project is designed as a **production‑style graduation project** that showcases complex business logic, layered architecture, and clean frontend state management — making it suitable for both recruiters and contributors to explore.

## 🩺 Project Overview

Kleitech helps kidney patients stay on top of their care by integrating:

- **Patient‑facing web app** built with React, TypeScript, and Vite.
- **Secure Laravel 11 API** with Sanctum, role‑based authorization, and structured domain models for patients, doctors, chats, appointments, reminders, and comments.
- **AI image analysis pipeline** (via a separate FastAPI service) that classifies uploaded medical images and streams results back to the UI.

The frontend is organized around layouts (`landing`, `auth`, `main`, `dashboard`, `chat`), while the backend exposes a rich set of REST endpoints (`/register`, `/login`, chat, appointments, reminders, stats, comments, etc.) wired through dedicated controllers and middleware. The Laravel backend concentrates most of the **complex domain logic**: enforcing booking rules, guarding admin/doctor actions, managing reminders, and orchestrating chat flows across multiple models and middlewares.

## ✨ Key Features

- **End‑to‑End Auth & Security**
  - Registration, login, logout, password reset with OTP emails.
  - Laravel Sanctum‑protected routes covering chat, doctors, patients, reminders, stats, and more (`backend/routes/api.php`).
  - Guarded dashboard routes and auth‑aware layouts on the frontend (`ProtectAuthRoutes`, `ProtectMainRoutes`, `ProtectDashboardRoutes`).

- **Doctor–Patient Chat with Rich UX**
  - Chat sessions, message listing, editing, deleting, and reactions handled in `ChatController` and related Eloquent models.
  - Frontend chat experience built from `ChatLayout`, `ChatHeader`, `ChatMessages`, `ChatFooter`, `ChatListItem`, emoji picker, and reactions.
  - Backend encapsulates complex chat life‑cycle rules, reaction handling, and participant permissions.

- **Intelligent Medical Image Analysis (AI)**
  - Patients can upload X‑ray/scan images directly from the home/consultation flows.
  - `clsPhoto` in `src/api/main/aiApi.tsx` sends images to the AI service, tracks upload progress, and interprets both **JSON results** and **image blobs** with a `classification` header.
  - UI orchestrates upload state, progress bars, error handling, and rendering AI‑annotated images.

- **Appointments, Booking & Admin Dashboard**
  - Backend endpoints such as:
    - `GET /appointments/available/{doctor_id}`
    - `POST /appointments/reserve/{appointment_id}`
  - Admin/doctor dashboards (`HomeDashboard`, `Doctors`, `Patients`, `ConsultationEmails`) provide:
    - Doctor/patient management.
    - Consultation email triage and response workflows.
    - Stats aggregation via `StatsController`.
  - Role‑based middleware ensures only the right roles can book, approve, or modify critical data.

- **Multi‑Channel Reminders & Notifications**
  - Laravel models and `ReminderController` handle **medication**, **water**, and **dialysis** reminders.
  - Frontend flows under `/m/alarm` and `/m/reminder` with specialized components (`MedicineAlarm`, `WaterAlarm`, `XRayAlarm`).
  - Utility logic (`src/utils/alarmReminder.ts` + `date-fns`) keeps reminders consistent, time‑zone aware, and user friendly.

- **Landing, Marketing & Contact Flows**
  - Structured landing sections: `AboutUs`, `Benefit`, `OurServices`, `PatientReviews`, `JoinUs`, `ContactUs`.
  - `ContactUsForm` integrates with `@emailjs/browser` for sending consultation and contact emails.
  - Designed to clearly communicate value to both patients and stakeholders.

The routing entrypoint is `Routers` (`src/routers/index.tsx`), which wires layouts and protected routes into the `App` component.

### Backend (`/backend`)

```

The Laravel layer is where most **complex application logic** lives: enforcing appointment availability, managing multi‑type reminders, securing chat and admin endpoints, and aggregating platform statistics.

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mohamed-Mos-aad/Graduation-Project.git
cd Graduation-Project
```

### 2. Frontend (React + Vite)

**Prerequisites**

- Node.js ≥ 18
- npm (or pnpm/yarn, if you adapt the commands)

**Install & run**

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173` by default.

**Environment variables (example)**

Create a `.env` file in the project root (or `.env.local`) with values such as:

```bash
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000/api
VITE_AI_API=http://127.0.0.1:8001
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=YOUR_DOMAIN
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_PROJECT_ID
# ...any other Firebase or service keys you use
```

### 3. Backend (Laravel 11 API)

**Prerequisites**

- PHP ≥ 8.2
- Composer
- A running SQL database (e.g., MySQL)

**Install & bootstrap**

```bash
cd backend
composer install
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
```

Configure your **database** and **mail** settings in `.env`, then run migrations:

```bash
php artisan migrate        # add --seed if you have seeders
php artisan serve
```

The API will run by default on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

> The Laravel backend is responsible for the “heavy lifting”: it enforces business rules for bookings and reminders, secures admin and doctor operations, and coordinates chat and comment workflows through its models, controllers, and middleware.

### 4. AI Service (Optional but Recommended)

The React frontend assumes an **AI image analysis service** reachable via `VITE_AI_API` and the `/analyze/` endpoint (see `src/api/main/aiApi.tsx`). You can:

- Plug in your own FastAPI or other service that accepts an image `FormData`, returns JSON or an annotated image, and sets a `classification` header.
- Or disable AI‑related UI paths if you are only interested in the core web app and Laravel API.
